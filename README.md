# Real-Time-Priority-Management-of-Ambulances-at-Traffic-Intersections

The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in India. Patients infected by
the virus are losing their lives mainly due to the de-saturation of their SPO2 levels. For these critical
patients every minute counts. Hence, transporting them to the hospitals in the least possible time is of
utmost importance. In this work, the authors have come up with a unique solution to reduce the transport
time of patients to hospitals by reducing the average waiting time at traffic intersections. In the metro
cities of India, the minimum average waiting time in a traffic intersection is 15s. The authors propose a
deep learning solution to tackle this problem. Wi-Fi enabled CCTV cameras at the traffic intersections
will detect an incoming ambulance using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 object detection algorithm.
Once, an ambulance is detected the next part of the model is triggered which is audio classification and
tagging. The ambulance siren is tagged and classified from the regular traffic noises. Immediately the
police inspector is made aware of the situation. As a prototype, the authors have built a hardware model
which can be easily installed in traffic intersections to make the other drivers aware of the incoming
ambulance through an LCD display and a buzzer. Immediately the traffic signal corresponding to this
path will be made green while shutting down the traffic signals of the remaining directions â€“ to allow safe
and quick passage of the ambulance through the traffic intersection. Statistical analysis of this work
shows 2/3rd of the waiting time can be reduced if the country can adopt to this system. This prototype will
surely add a positive note in saving the lives of critical patients.
